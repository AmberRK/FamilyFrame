Is there a need for a Subject Matter Expert (SME)?
No

What expertise is missing?
Database knowledge

3\. SOFTWARE PROCESS MODEL DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------------

The agile methodology will be used for this project. Agile allows for more flexible development and will respond to changing requirements as development progresses. Our project can be broken into independent features that are tackled concurrently each sprint. Features can then be integrated by the end of each sprint. We will also check our progress at the end of each sprint and have more accountability for deadlines.

However, Agile can also lead to burnout if there is not sufficient post-sprint review and unwinding. The short nature of sprints may also encourage development of small, non-critical features. Documentation may suffer due to the fast pace. Not enough time can be spent for retrospection and lead to problems further in development. Features may be designed too quickly and inelegantly which will put us into code debt, a system that will require more work to fix later.

Waterfall ensure that components are complete and can be built upon but is inflexible for changing requirements which is likely in a senior project. Waterfall projects are easiliy tracked but Agile meetings following each sprint in Agile accomplishes the accountability that Waterfall provides.

4\. PRODUCT DEFINITION
---------------------

Describe the users and user environment.

### Context Diagram

Defines the scope of your system - what is inside the system and what is
outside the system. High level information flow between the system and
the outside users or other systems (personas)

### Personas

Below is a brief description of those people outside the system that the
system interfaces with.

### User Stories

Defines the high level user stories for the product

### High Level Use Cases

Defines the high level user stories for the product. Goal is to paint a
picture of the product, not define the whole solution. Includes diagram
and use case descriptions.

### Use Case Descriptions

Defines the high level descriptions

Be sure to the textual use case description consists of 6 parts:

1.  **Unique name**

2.  **Participating actors**

3.  **Entry conditions**

4.  **Exit conditions**

5.  **Flow of events: 5 - 7 steps describing the Happy Path**

6.  **Special requirements.**

Below are the high level use cases for the Application, based on the
above use case diagram.

5\. USER EXPERIENCE WIREFRAMES
-----------------------------

Initial prototype screens to validate initial understanding of the
product.

6\. PROJECT ORGANIZATION
-----------------------

Breakdown of major tasks and schedule

### Matrix of Responsibilities

Defines the high level which team members are responsible for which
tasks

### PERT / Gantt Chart

First cut at schedule

7\. VALIDATION PLAN
------------------

### Test Strategy

What is the definition of done?

What does success look like?

8\. FEASIBILITY STUDY
--------------------

What are the known risks and how will they be handled?

### Risk Identification and Prioritization

1. The tree creation system breaks.
2. Database runs into issues (when being put into place)
3. Database runs into issues (when being accessed to save and pull trees by user)
4. Minor features won’t be implemented in time

### Risk Mitigation

1.  Keep backups of the progress and closely watch for any errors when testing the final product
2.  Closely watch for any SQL errors and ensure there is no conflicts
3.  Debug, pinpoint the issues, attempt to find a solution
4.  Chop unimportant ideas, organize the priority of important features

What are you going to prototype?
Huh?

9\. CONFIGURATION AND VERSION CONTROL
------------------------------------

Specify the process and attributes for version control for all project
and product artifacts

10\. TOOLS
---------

Provide a list of tools required for the project and their use

11\. ARCHITECTURE
----------------

List of hardware or other subsystems required for the product.
